## Importing and Compiling on GitHub

If all went well, you should now have a link to a git repository containing your ZMK configurations. Go to <https://github.com/new/import> and import the repository into your GitHub account. Your GitHub repository should be ready in a few minutes after clicking "Begin import".

The git repository hosted by Shield Wizard is only **kept for 24 hours**, make sure to import it before then.

A GitHub Actions workflow is included in the repository to compile the firmware on GitHub. It will run automatically when you push changes to the repository, but for the initial build, you will need to manually trigger it:

1. Go to the "**Actions**" tab of your newly imported repository.
2. Select the "**Build ZMK Firmware**" workflow from the left sidebar.
3. Click the "**Run workflow**" button on the right side, then click the green "**Run workflow**" button in the popup.

You don't need to manually trigger the workflow for future changes, it will run automatically.

After a few minutes, the workflow should complete successfully. You can then download the compiled firmware from the "Artifacts" section of the workflow run.

Shield Wizard shouldn't generate any invalid configurations, but if the build fails, please send feedback to [Shield Wizard GitHub repository](https://github.com/Genteure/zmk-wizard) or join the [ZMK Community Discord](https://zmk.dev/community/discord/invite) for help.

## Testing the Firmware

You should test the firmware on your keyboard before changing anything. The default keymap generated by Shield Wizard is a sequence of A, B, C, ... Z then looping back to A. It's perfect for verifying that all keys are working correctly.

In addition to the firmwares for your specific keyboard, we also added a ["settings reset" firmware](https://zmk.dev/docs/troubleshooting/connection-issues#building-a-reset-firmware) for your convenience.

All controllers Shield Wizard currently supports have UF2 bootloaders. To flash the firmware:

1. Double-tap the reset button within 0.5 seconds to enter bootloader mode. The controller should appear as a removable drive on your computer.
    - Don't have a reset button? Short the `RST` and `GND` pins twice within 0.5 seconds with a jumper wire or tweezers.
2. Copy the coorresponding `.uf2` firmware file to the removable drive. The controller will automatically disconnect and reboot with the new firmware.

You should now test the keyboard over USB and BLE (if applicable). For [split keyboards](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/split-keyboards), only the first part (usually the left side) will have USB connectivity, all other parts only talk to the first part over an internal BLE connection.

## Compile options

After you have verified the basic firmware is working, you can start customizing it further.

If you want to build with ZMK Studio support or compile firmware for the dongle setup, you need to modify `build.yaml` in the root of the repository.
Shield Wizard generates `build.yaml` with some builds commented out.

Uncomment the sections you want to enable by **removing one single `#` at the start of each line and nothing else**. YAML is very sensitive to indentation (amount of spaces on each line), removing or adding spaces may result in invalid YAML syntax.

## ZMK options and keymap

Change ZMK options and keymap by editing files in the `config` folder.

Things you may want to change:

- A new keymap <https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps#keymap-file>
- `&bt` in the keymap to manage Bluetooth connections <https://zmk.dev/docs/keymaps/behaviors/bluetooth>
- Battery reporting and battery proxy <https://zmk.dev/docs/config/battery>
- Deep sleep for improved battery life <https://zmk.dev/docs/config/power>
- USB Boot protocol to use the keyboard in BIOS/UEFI <https://zmk.dev/docs/config/system#usb>

"github.dev" (made by GitHub) is a better editor than the standard GitHub web interface. You can open your repository in "github.dev" by going to `https://github.dev/<your-username>/<your-repo>`.

[Keymap Editor](https://nickcoutsos.github.io/keymap-editor/) is a web-based keymap editor for ZMK, it intergrates with GitHub and can directly edit the keymap file in your repository. Shield Wizard generates the layout json file required by Keymap Editor to render your keymap.

[ZMK Studio](https://zmk.dev/docs/features/studio) can edit keymap at runtime over BLE and USB, but it lacks some features compared to editing the keymap file directly.
